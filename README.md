# Some Favorite Quotes

Love. Is bizzare. You never know when it weaves around your heart. There's always a little grey area beyond right and wrong. If this mortal world enables me to, I will meet you there.... Will you spare me a few minutes? Just a few minutes? Where you will just be mine? Mine and mine alone? Let me smear you with all the love my heart knows and has piled up over the years? And love me back a little? Maybe caress my hairs and let me snuggle in your warm embrace under a thousand stars... My love is poetical. It is like a flower. Fragrant when blooms, draped in memories when dries up. Gifted in love and in death. My endeavour? Both. Don't ask why. Isn't loving synonymous to death? 

If I have ever been closest to being in love, it is with you. And knowing you will never be able to love me back, is death....


When I look back, all I do is smile at our tittle tattles on mountains or seas. You always loved the mountains and me...the seas. Now that we don't even exist in each other's lives (hearts? Can't guarantee my bit...), I find mountains alluring more than ever before. Maybe  because they are a remnant of your love and admiration. Maybe because I try to find you in the echoes, the gushing brooks, the floral valleys and snow showers of the mountains? 

I wonder if you visit the seashore and try to find me in waves - cracking and receding.... Do you remember me, love? Do you remember me like I do? Every day in and every day out?

Ignorance. It haunts. Just like the ghost of that haunted castle where love died in oblivion. But don't they say love, if true in its essence, never dies? Do they exaggerate? Or is it an elaborate imagination of human emotions? Maybe they are true. Love never dies. Its soul lives in perpetuity. Do you remember that old book that made you smile? Or the first time you took your baby pet in your lap? The first time you rested your head on your lover's lap? The very first kiss? The first time of drenching in a heavy downpour? Time has passed. Those little moments of love have passed. But have they died? They live in your remembrance. And everytime nostalgia hits your heart, love becomes lovelier. 

Yet what did you choose? Ignorance. Denial. Maybe turning a blind eye was your escape but ever wondered it could haunt love, trapped in that old castle of memories?
